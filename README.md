Tandem project used in determining legal moves on a backgammon board.

Recently overhauled earlier solution when I discovered it and move notation did not jive at all. New solution is to recursively solve a board using one die first, then with the other first, then reporting back unique results. Haven't tested it yet, but my algorithm should work with a longer set of rolls.
